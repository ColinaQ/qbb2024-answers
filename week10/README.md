# Exercise 3.1

"Gene_ID" represents the name of the gene that has been knocked down in the sample. "nascentRNA" shows the mean signal intensity of the nascent RNA channel, measured using the Alexa488 dye, for each nucleus; it measures how much RNA is being transcribed. "PCNA" shows the mean signal intensity of the PCNA channel, measured using the Alexa568 dye, for each nucleus; it measures the level of replication activity. "log2ratio" shows the log2-transformed ratio of nascent RNA signal to PCNA signal for each nucleus; it measures the relative RNA synthesis levels compared to DNA synthesis levels in the nucleus.

# Exercise 3.2

APEX1 knockdown has the highest ratio and SRSF1 has the lowest ratio. Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APEX1) is an important enzyme in base excision repair (BER). Its knockdown likely impairs replication while having a lesser impact on transcription. This leads to a higher log2 ratio. Serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) encodes a protein that can either activate or repress splicing, thereby regulate RNA splicing and stability in the nucleus. Its knockdown affects transcription more than replication, and this leads to a lower log2 ratio.
