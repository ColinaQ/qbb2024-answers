The feature under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection is exons.
The log2-transformed enrichment for exons is always under 0 across all MAFs. Since negative enrichment values indicate depletion of SNPs in these regions, it suggests that mutations in exons are being selected against, meaning they are likely harmful 
and subject to stronger purifying selection.
Most features more enriched at lower MAFs and become depleted as MAF increases. At lower MAFs, rare SNPs, which are often harmful, accumulate in functionally important regions.
The relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense. Exons show the strongest depletion, and this makes sense because they are coding genes that are epxressed. Mutations that occur here are more harmful and subject to purifying selection. cCREs and introns show less depletion because they are not coding regions, and mutations here are less harmful. Other regions show little depletion. This shows that they are under less constraint and it makes sense because they are probably non-coding and less important.
